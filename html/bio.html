            <p>
                I was born in Seoul, South Korea, on the 7th of January 1993. <br>
                However, I only lived in South Korea until the age of 4, at which point my family moved to Paris, France.<br>
                There, I attended a french primary and middle school and grew up learning both Korean and French.<br><br>

                Luckily for me, my adventure did not end there. At age 12 I moved to Singapore with my parents.<br>
                There, I learned English by attending an international high school: the United World College of South East Asia.<br>
                During my high school years, I particularly enjoyed the sciences, especially physics and chemistry. I also grew fond of
                mathematics.
                <br>
                In May 2011, I graduated with an International Baccalaureate diploma, with a score of 43 out of 45.
                <br><br>
                
                In fall 2011, I started attending the School of Engineering at Tufts University. <br>
                Although I was going to major in Mechanical Engineering at first, I quickly realized the charm of 
                Computer Science when I took my first intro class. <br>
                It struck me that my love for technology, media and video games could be expressed in a much better fashion 
                if I majored in Computer Science.
                <br>
                So here I am today: a proud member of the computer science community.
