                        <p>
                            I was born in Seoul, South Korea.<br>
                            However, I only lived in South Korea until the age of 4, at which point my family moved to Paris, France.<br>
                            There, I attended a French primary and middle school. I hence grew up learning both Korean and French.<br><br>

                            Luckily for me, my adventure did not end there. At age 12 I moved to Singapore.<br>
                            There, I learned English by attending an international high school: the United World College of South East Asia.<br>
                            During my high school years, I particularly enjoyed the sciences, especially physics and chemistry. I also grew fond of mathematics.
                            <br>
                            In May 2011, I graduated with an International Baccalaureate diploma, with a score of 43 out of 45.
                            <br><br>
                            
                            In fall 2011, I started attending the School of Engineering at Tufts University. <br>
                            Although I was going to major in Mechanical Engineering at first, I quickly realized the charm of 
                            Computer Science when I took my first intro class. <br>
                            It struck me that my love for technology, media and video games could be expressed in a much better fashion if I majored in Computer Science.
                            <br> <br>
                            My hobbies include cooking, watching movies/TV shows, gaming, calligraphy and drawing.
