Everything has been implemented correctly.
The three pages (index.html, bio.html and resume.html) contain all the appropriate information.
Furthermore, they all pass the html5 and css tests online.
Finally, cs.tufts.edu/~hpark02 correctly redirects to my github website.

I have worked alone for this project.

I spent about 3 hours for this project.
